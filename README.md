# pwsh
PowerShell scripts, tools, and helpful commands.  This repo will contain several handy scripts for easing day-to-day administration for various products.  It will likely also contain some helpful one-line commands for Sysadmins, threat hunters, etc.

Take a look at the [UsefulCommands.ps1](https://github.com/Suriyawong/pwsh/blob/main/UsefulCommands.ps1) for some handy one-liners like:

``` powershell
# Capture the date in YYYY.MM.DD.HHmm format (I use this format to version my scripts):
Get-Date -UFormat "%Y.%m.%d.%H%M"
```


# List of working tools
None yet!  Since I don't own the code at my job, I have to write PowerShell at home from scratch.  Check back for some handy tools later.

# List of scripts to build
